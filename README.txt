>>> Security Algebra.exe runs with the original password: charlie631

>>> Password Generator.cpp is the code for Security Algebra

>>> This is a simple algorithm that comes to my mind for making a random password generator.
    
>>> It sets a sequence of combination of alphabet and digit into 2 lists: list x and list y.
    Shifts the combination of both lists according to the number of X and Y,
    which depends on the absolute values of the highest point of X and Y in a function.
    And that function changes (depends) on the date and time when the program executed.
